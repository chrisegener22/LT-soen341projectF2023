We are designing a website that will simplify the buying, selling, and renting market. With our sleek design and easy-to-use use interface you will be able to easily navigate the website. With our numerous sorting methods, you will be able to sort through all of the available listings down to only those that exactly match your criteria.

For the front-end frameworks, we looked at React, Angular and Vu.js. We wanted to use a framework that most of the team members hadn't used, as we were all looking to use this project as a learning opportunity for new frameworks. We eventually decided against React because we learned that it had a steeper learning curve than most, and as a team we felt that this project wasn't too appropriate. Furthermore, it's features such as the two-way data binding, dependency injection and external element decoupling weren't too useful for our project scale.
